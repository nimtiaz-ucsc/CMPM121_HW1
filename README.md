# Homework 1 - Craft a Scene

### Description:
My scene is a small office room. The objects I included in this scene are some furniture (a desk and chair), a retro 90s era PC (with a monitor, PC tower, keyboard, and mouse), and some other miscellaneous objects (a phone, a lamp, a trash can, a potted plant, and a water cooler). I was inspired by my own office room at home; some of the elements in my scene are inspired by real room (i.e. style of furniture, placement of objects, etc.). The main character of my scene is the large statue of a businessman standing near the desk.
